Before issuing the process, it is open to the Court to record the evidence, and on consideration of the averments made in the complaint and the evidence thus adduced, find out whether an offence has been made out.

Appellant (Dr. Subramanian Swamy) had the right to file a complaint for prosecuting respondent No.2 (Minister of the Union Cabinet) – Every Competent Authority (Prime Minister / respondent 1, in this case) shall take appropriate action on the representation made by a citizen for sanction of the prosecution of a public servant strictly in accordance with the direction contained in Vineet Narain v. Union of India (1998) 1 SCC 226 and the Guidelines framed by the CVC – Appeal from Judgment of Delhi High Court allowed.
Per A.K.Ganguly, J: All proposals for sanction placed before any Sanctioning Authority, empowered to grant sanction for the prosecution of a public servant under Section 19 of PC Act must be decided within a period of three months of the receipt of the proposal by the concerned authority; At the end of the extended period of time limit, if no decision is taken, sanction will be deemed to have been granted to the proposal for prosecution – Directions given.

    HIGH COURT CITATIONS CIVIL CASES
 2012 -1-TLNJ 1 (Civil)
Maria Margarida Sequeria Fernandes and Ors Vs
Erasmo Jack De SEqueria (Dead) Through L.Rs.
Civil procedure code 1908 as amended – Pleadings – proof explained – party who claims possession must give all such details as issue, and the Court can reject the claim or pass a decree on admission – Principles of law explained and crystallized – even by long possession of years or decades such person would not acquire any right or interest in the said property – suit dismissed.
Civil procedure code 1908 as amended Order 39, Rule 1 – Suit for injunction against the true owner – was not maintainable – See Section 6 of Specific Relief Act 1963.
Specific Relief Act, 1963, Section 6 – Possession by Caretaker, Servant, Watchmen or Gratuitous stay – suit for injunction a caretaker’s possession can never be a possession on individual’s right and no such suit for injunction under Section 6 of the Specific Relief Act was maintainable – held that No one acquires title to the property if her or she was allowed to stay in the premises gratuitously – even by long possession of years or decades such person would not acquire any right or interest in the said property it further held that Caretaker, watchman or servant can never acquire interest in the property irrespective of his long possession – the caretaker or servant has to give (up) possession (of the property) forthwith on demand – Apex Court also laid fresh guidelines that caretakers, watchman or servants do not acquire any title to a property merely because of its possession by them for several years – Court further observed that Litigation pertaining to valuable real estate properties is dragged on by unscrupulous litigants in the hope that the other party will tire out and ultimately would settle with them by paying a huge amount – which happens because of the enormous delay in adjudication of cases in our courts? If pragmatic approach is adopted, then this problem can be minimized to a large extent.

      7

rightly be shown towards the plaintiff for improving upon her pleadings and also in adducing evidence, in the interest of justice – As disposed a accordingly.

Petition filed by Defendant before Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB) Chennai – Suit whether maintainable? – Held, mere filing of Revocation Petition before IPA Board would not ipso facto give rise to a cause of action in Madras High Court – Moreover, mere fact that clinical tests were conducted by Defendants in 2005 in laboratory in Chennai, would not give rise to cause of action to invoke jurisdiction of Madras High Court in 2011.

Boards & Forums – Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB) – IPA Board constituted by a Gazette Notification of Central Government in Ministry of Commerce and Industry on 15.9.2003 to hear Appeals – IPA has its headquarters at Chennai and shall have sittings at Chennai, Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Ahmedabad – Filing of Revocation Petition in Chennai is by statutory compulsion – Mere filing of an Application for revocation in IPA Board, Chennai cannot give rise to a cause of action – After filing of Revocation Petition before IPA Board at Chennai and after scrutinizing Application, IPA Board may have hearing either at Chennai or where parties opt to have hearing – Once Respondent appeared and filed their response, by and large proceedings would be heard in situs that patent was granted, unless parties choose otherwise – Thus, mere filing of Revocation Petition before IPA Board in Chennai cannot amount to giving rise cause of action and can only be stated as a transitory one.
Patents Act, 1970 (39 of 1970), Sections 47, 48, 49, 64 & 107 – Infringement – What is – Statements made in Revocation Petition whether amount to cause of action? – Where subject matter of Patent is a product or where subject matter of Patent is a process it confers exclusive right on Patentee to prevent others from doing certain acts – Any intrusion into monopoly rights of Patentee would amount to infringement – Patent granted subject to conditions detailed in Section 47 – Any action within purview of Section 47 would not amount to infringement – Sections 49 & 107-A exclude certain acts from being considered as an infringement – Under Section 107, person against whom an infringement action is instituted may take up as a defence any ground on which patent may be
    11

revoked under Section 64 – Whether averments made in Revocation Petition would fall within scope of infringement – In instant case, averments in Revocation Petition filed by Appellants herein before IPA Board Chennai amount to threat to infringement and therefore, Respondents are entitled to file a quia timet action – Held, if such statements made in Revocation Petition would give rise to cause of action to invoke jurisdiction of Madras High Court, all Revocation Petitions filed before IPA Chennai, which has its registry at Chennai would invariably contain such statements and in all such cases if jurisdiction of Madras High Court is to be invoked, Madras High Court would be flooded with Suits for infringement of a Patent – Held, statements made in Revocation Petition without anything more cannot give rise to a cause of action to invoke jurisdiction of Madras High Court.
Words and Phrases – “Cause of action” – Meaning of – Expression acquired a judicially settled meaning – Cause of action consists of bundle of facts, which Plaintiff must prove in order to get a judgment in his favour – Whether any part of cause of action has occurred within jurisdiction of Court would depend upon facts and circumstances of case.

Criminal Procedure Code, Sections 325, 482.
Section 325 CrPC enables the Magistrate to refer the case to his superior officer, namely, the Chief Judicial Magistrate – Next, the Magistrate must form an opinion that the accused deserve a different kind of punishment or more severe punishment than that which he is empowered to inflict upon him.
A mere finding of a criminal court is no judgment – it is one part of the decision of the Court – It transforms into a judgment only when sentence or order, as the case may be, is passed.
      17

Once a case is referred by the Magistrate to the Chief Judicial Magistrate he alone has to take further action as per the procedure prescribed and the power conferred upon him under section 325 (3) CrPC – He cannot disown it nor delegate it unless it is a case falling under section 323 CrPC.
Order of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Vellore remanding back the calendar case to the referral Judicial Magistrate, Tirupattur is manifestly erroneous.
